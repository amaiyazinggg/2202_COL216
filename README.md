This repository contains the assignments for the Undergraduate Course on Computer Architecture at IIT Delhi, Spring Semester 2023.

## Assignment 1
Writing MIPS assembly programs to perform the following tasks
1. To print the input string after saving it to the heap.
2. To perform an iterative binary search to check if an element exists in a sorted array.
3. To perform a recursive computation of x^n.

## Assignment 2
The assignment is based on implementing the 5 stage and the 7-9 stage MIPS pipelines with and without bypass in C++.
1. 5 Stage Basic MIPS pipeline without bypassing
2. 5 Stage Basic MIPS pipeline with bypassing
3. 7-9 Stage pipeline without and with bypassing
4. Report with cycle comparison plots and code quality
5. Branch prediction for control hazard 

## Assignment 3
This assignment involves writing a simulator code for an arbitrary n-way set associative cache in C++, running several simulations and plotting graphs
to observe variations in the total access time versus various memory parameters.
